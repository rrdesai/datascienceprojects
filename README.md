#Data Science Projects

#### This is a collection of data science projects that I have completed during and after the Metis Bootcamp. 

### Notes
Many of the projects I have completed use the scrapy framework.
For more information regarding filestructure and logic please see the "Creating a Project" section of the scrapy tutorial available at https://doc.scrapy.org/intro/tutorial.html
