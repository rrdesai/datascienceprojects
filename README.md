## Data Science Projects

#### This is a collection of data science projects that I have completed during and after the Metis Bootcamp. 

#### Notes

Many of the projects I have completed use the scrapy framework. In terms of code location, the actual logic for the webscrapers can be found in the python files located in the spiders folder of a given project. I am also currently in progeress with re-locating my notebooks for clearer readability so the file references in these notebooks may be slightly broken for the time being. Ultimately, I will be storing all of my scraped data in a data/ folder within each project's parent directory. 

For more information regarding scrapy's filestructure and logic please see the "Creating a Project" section of the scrapy tutorial available at https://doc.scrapy.org/intro/tutorial.html

Apologies on the lack of comments in the notebooks as well. These are only just being readied for wider consumption and will be remedied soon. If there are any questions on particular sections or logic, please do reach out and ask!
